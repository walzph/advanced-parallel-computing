parallelizing a job rarely multiplies its memory requirements by p

MIPS should be accompanied by 1mbyte of memory

if one processor does not provide enough power, multiple processors should be used to make effective use if the memorys capacity and bandwith

costperf(p) < costperf(1) => better

parallel computing is more cost effective whenever speedup(p) > costup(p)

m small or p large, m' much larger than m, because m/p puts too few memory chips with each processor to adequately satisfy the processors bandwith requirements

when memory is sufficiently large (and expensive), more than one processor should be used to make effective use of the memory capacity and bandwidth

if one processor does not provide enough power, multiple processors should be used to balance the memorys capacity and bandwidth

software development costs maybe higher for parallel applications
